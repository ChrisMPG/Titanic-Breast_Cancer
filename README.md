This is a school project where the main focus was to do a Descriptive and Exploratory analysis using the titanic.csv dataset and perform a PCA Analysis using the breast_cancer.csv 

// The Idea

 As for the Titanic dataset, the objective was to go in depth into the dataset analysing every meaningful column using some visualizations.
 
 For the breast cancer dataset, the main objetive is analysing the principal components (PCA) of the dataset in order to check which variables will go into each PCA component and the behaviour of each patient.  Passando agora para a aplicação da feature selection, é fulcral fazer 


// My Role

So, I am required to use my knowledge in the DEA( Descriptive and Exploratory Analysis) and implement a PCA unsupervised machine learning model.

// Technologies
R, Rstudio
